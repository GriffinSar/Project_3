# Sales Calculator

### Purpose


# Target Audience
The Target Audience for this website is sales reps. These reps have a number of manual calculatitons and currency conversion that needs to be done to prepare a quote for their customer. This app is designed to take away some of this manual work so that the sales rep can concentrate on selling the products to the customer rather than focusing so much time on administration work.
This is the sort of functionality that many CRM systems implement to streamline quoting for customers. 

# User Stories
### First Time Visitor Goals
A first time visitor wants to be able to choose wether they want to convert a currency or to price a renewal quote. They want to be able to input the spcific data of this quote and have it stored by the system in an excel. The user also wants to be able to get the price for a 2 or 3 year renewal so they can present the three options to their customers.
### Returning Visitor Goals
A returning visitor wants to be able to use the app to convert currency or price a quote just as the first time visitor. But this user also wants to be able to access previous quote data for users so they can see a list of previous priced quotes for this customer.

### Frequent Visitor Goals
A frequent Visitor wants to be able to convert currency. They also want to be able to access legacy pricing date along with being able to price new quotes and also get previous pricing for a specific customer if there is any.
